# Building

First, you need to have a few things installed.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
- SDL2 if you're on Linux.

To build just use `cargo build` in the root directory.

# ToDo

- [ ] Maybe switch out the cooley-tukey FFT with a Stockham implementation?
- [ ] Refactor SceneData cbuffer in shaders.
- [ ] Smooth the camera movement.
- [ ] Add better camera controls (e.g., only rotate when you're holding Ctrl + mouse movement).
- [ ] Figure out why the fragment shader outputs very pixelated(?) colors and fix that.
- [ ] Support window resizing + fullscreen.
- [ ] Support shader hot-reloading.
- [x] Check Empirical directional wave spectra for computer graphics for better, more realistic waves.
- [ ] Add realistic shading of the ocean surface.
- [ ] Perhaps replace the simple skybox with something that simulates the sky based on Rayleigh scattering?
- [ ] Perhaps add a way to specify what the pipeline will look like from the shaders?
- ~[ ] Maybe do physical camera as is done [here](https://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2017/09/physical-cameras-in-stingray.html)?~
