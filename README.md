# ToDo

- Move Camera into its own file.
- Get the skybox shader to work with arbitrary resolutions.
- Maybe switch out the cooley-tukey FFT with a Stockham implementation?
- Smooth the camera movement.
- Add better camera controls (e.g., only rotate when you're holding Ctrl + mouse movement).
- Figure out why the fragment shader outputs very pixelated(?) colors and fix that.
- Support window resizing + fullscreen.
- Support shader hot-reloading.
- Check Empirical directional wave spectra for computer graphics for better, more realistic waves.
- Add realistic shading of the ocean surface.
- Perhaps replace the simple skybox with something that simulates the sky based on Rayleigh scattering?
